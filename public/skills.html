        <br/>
        <p>I have sound knowledge of Maths, English and Computer Science along with experience using various Microsoft Office applications such as PowerPoint and Excel. I have completed a plethora of projects which include the designing of my own system using Microsoft Visual Basic which is connected to a database made with Microsoft Access.  I have also created my own 2D game using the Processing Programming Language which I particularly enjoyed. </p>

    <p>I am enthusiastic about finding creative solutions to issues, so  I revel in completing projects I undertake in my software engineering program. I am self-motivated to consistently provide first class results in line with stringent targets and deadlines. As well as this, I have a lot of experience in customer management and people skills, which is useful as it has increased my patience, communication abilities and group work. </p>
